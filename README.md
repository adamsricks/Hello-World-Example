# Hello-World-Example

### Description
This is just your basic "hello world" example, where I use Python to print "hello world" to the screen.

### How to set it up
You'll need an IDE like VS Code, and you'll have to install the most recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### How to build
Python is integrated, so you won't need much more than Python and an IDE.
